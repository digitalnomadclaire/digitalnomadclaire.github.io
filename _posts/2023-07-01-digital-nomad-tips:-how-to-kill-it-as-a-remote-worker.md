Hey there, it's Claire Lago — digital nomad, nonprofit employee, lover of travel, and past corporate finance guru. I've been living the nomadic life for over six years now and it's been one hell of a ride! Today, I want to share some kickass tips on how to thrive as a remote worker, whether you're sailing the seven seas or chilling in a coffee shop in a delightful little town.

## **1. Get your tech in check**
First things first, your tech game has got to be on point. The right combination of [hardware](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-laptops-remote-work) and [software](https://zapier.com/blog/best-remote-work-tools/) can transform remote work from a drudge to a daydream. Got to hop on a virtual meeting from a busy café in Vietnam? A laptop with a killer battery life and noise-cancelling headphones are absolute lifesavers.

## **2. Master time management**
Time management skills are crucial to remote work, especially when you’re hopping across multiple time zones. I recommend using tools like [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) or [Asana](https://asana.com/) to keep track of your time and tasks. Having a clear idea of your work schedule can also help you make the most of your travel adventures.

## **3. Get connected**
Working remotely doesn’t mean working alone. Join [digital nomad communities](https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/best-digital-nomad-communities/) and engage with other remote workers. They're not just great for exchanging work tips, they can also give you some amazing advice on places to visit, where to eat, and must-have experiences.

## **4. Take care of yourself**
Remote work can be demanding, and it's easy to get burnt out. Make sure you maintain a healthy work-life balance. Even if you’re in the world’s most exciting city, don’t feel guilty about taking a day off to binge-watch your favorite show or catching up on some zzz's with a midday nap. Your mind and body will thank you for it.

## **5. Make room for learning**
The world of remote work is constantly evolving. Keep on top of the latest trends and technologies by engaging in continuous learning. Websites like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) offer super helpful courses on everything from cutting-edge software to enhancing your soft skills.

## **6. Keep track of your money matters**
Converting pounds to pesos can be confusing AF, and costs can rack up quickly. Stay on top of your finances with apps like [Trail Wallet](http://voyagetravelapps.com/trail-wallet/) to track your expenses. And remember, living nomadically can impact your taxes, so it’s good to consult with a [tax professional](https://www.theglobalcitizen.co/nomad-tax-issues-explained/) to avoid those nasty surprise bills.

And my final tip, you ask? Just dive right in! The beautiful locations, the freedom, and the experiences you’ll have as a digital nomad all make the challenges totally worth it. 

But enough about me. Now it's your turn. What's your top tip for nailing the remote work lifestyle? Tweet me at [@ClaireLago](https://twitter.com/ClaireLago). Looking forward to hearing your pearls of wisdom!
