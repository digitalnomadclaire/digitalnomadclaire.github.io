Hey there wonderful people, Claire Lago here! üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It's been a year of being a digital nomad - leaving the hustle of corporate finance to work remotely with a non-profit organization. It's been one wild ride, that's for sure. From finding the perfect backpack that fits my mobile office to sipping matcha at my zen Airbnb in Japan - I've been there, done that.

I love pulling out my MacBook at a park, a coffee shop, or just about anywhere with a WiFi signal in sight. Turns out, you CAN live the dream while making the world a better place. One WiFi signal at a time! 

Enough of the chit chat though, I know why you're here. You want a slice of this digital nomad pie. So, here are my top digital nomad tips based on my experiences so far.

## Don't be afraid to experiment 

Here's the deal; not all work environments will suit you. One day you might love the sound of waves lapping on the shore as you work, the next you might want the hustle of a busy coffee shop. It's all good. Embrace the freedom to find your ideal work environment. 

## Invest in a quality travel backpack

I cannot stress this enough guys, invest in a quality travel backpack. You need something practical, durable and stylish too. I personally love my [WANDRD PRVKE](https://www.wandrd.com/products/prvke) backpack. Yes, it's bit on the expensive side, but it's worth every penny in terms of utility and longevity.

## Find your balance

Balance, my friends, is key. You'll realise very quickly that the line between work and life can get blurred when you're a digital nomad. Set boundaries for yourself - establish dedicated work hours and stick to them.

## Stay connected

Communication is the thread that keeps remote work together. Tap into tools like [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/) for quick chats, [Trello](https://trello.com/) for task management or [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for face-to-face meetings (virtually, that is!). These tools are lifesavers.

## Plan ahead

Imagine jetting off to a distant country only to realise your banking app isn't supported there? Yikes! Plan ahead to avoid any such hiccups. This includes understanding the cost of living, working out your itinerary, arranging your accommodation in advance and checking in with clients or your employer to ensure you are able to work in your new temporary home.

## Get insured 

So this one is a biggie that people often forget. Having a robust travel insurance plan is crucial. After lot of research, I landed with [World Nomads](https://www.worldnomads.com/). Their coverage is comprehensive, and the buying process was smooth. (Always read the fine print though!)

There it is, folks. My tried and tested digital nomad tips for you. When you get down to it, being a digital nomad is all about finding what works for you - whether you're working with a non-profit organisation like me or living the startup dream. It's about the freedom, the exploration, and the joy of discovery.

Remember, the world is your office. Now go out there and make the most of it. 

Until next time,
Claire üó∫Ô∏è
