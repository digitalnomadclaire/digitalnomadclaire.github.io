Hello, beach-bummers and mountain-climbers, it's Claire Lago, your neighborhood digital nomad. Today isn't about exotic treks or magic bagpacking tricks. It's about something serious that made all my travelling dreams possible : remote work. I know, COVID shifted everyone's workstations from claustrophobic cubicles to comfy couches. But lemme tell you guys, remote work can be a tough nut to crack. So, fasten your seatbelts as I take you through the galaxy of remote work tips that transformed me to a star digital nomad from a corporate finance xenophobic.

###1.  Self-discipline: A Key to Successful Remote Work

Firstly, list out your tasks, set deadlines so that you don't end up checking out dog videos or binge-watching Friends in your work hours. Trust me, I'd trouble focusing until I found [Trello](https://trello.com/) that nailed it with their project management and task scheduling features. 

###2. Get Dressed for Work – Seriously!

This might seem weird but getting dressed up helps your mind shift gears from the lazy "home" mode to the bustling "work" mode. You should definitely check out [Uniqlo's](https://www.uniqlo.com/) easy-to-wear loungewear line, which is absolutely comfortable to work in.

###3. Create a Dedicated Workspace

Working on a comfy couch sounds fun, but your back won't be singing the same tune after a few days. So investing in creating a workspace is a real game-changer. You don't need much, just a sturdy desk and a comfortable chair from [IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/) to kickstart.

###4. Workout Regularly

A sedentary lifestyle is a major pitfall of remote work. Make time for workouts even if it's just for 30 minutes. Websites like [Yoga International](https://yogainternational.com/) offer a wide range of online yoga classes that you can do anywhere, anytime.

###5. Make Full Use of Technology

Technology is the crux of remote work. Apps and tools make your work life unimaginably smooth. You should totally take advantage of [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) for collaboration and [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for video conferencing.

###6. Avoid Loneliness & Burnout

Working remotely could feel lonely at times and it's totally normal to miss those water-cooler chats. [Slack](https://slack.com/) helps you stay connected with your team. Engage in some non-work-related discussions to boost mental health & work productivity.

###7. Allocate Time for Breaks

Sitting on a chair for 8 hours straight can be more exhausting than you think. So, take regular breaks. And no, by break I don't mean scrolling through Instagram. Step away from all screens. For your short breaks, stretching or simple eye exercises should work. And for the longer ones, well, how about exploring the local area?

###8. Balance Work and Life

Remote working often blurs the line between personal time and work time. So take time off the work, engage in hobbies, or just chill with a cup of tea (or beer!).

###9. Stay Secure Online

Last but not least, cybersecurity! You might be working from a café or a hotel room, so ensure your equipment is secure. Use VPN, keep your system updated, and try not to share sensitive info on public Wi-Fi. I depend on [ExpressVPN](https://www.expressvpn.com/) and [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/) due to their top-notch security features and speedy servers.

Remember, like any other skill, remote working too needs practice. So don't be hard on yourself if you don't get it right in the first go. Implement one tip at a time and gradually you'll find what works best for you. Till then, keep travelling, keep working, and have loads of fun!

Signing off for today!

Until next time...Claire Lago, your friendly-neighbourhood digital nomad.
