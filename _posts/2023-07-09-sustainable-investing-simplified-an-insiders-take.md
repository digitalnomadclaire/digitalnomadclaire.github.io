Hey there! 

I'm Claire Lago, a digital nomad in her early thirties brushing her teeth with adventures, innovation and an inherent quest for sustainable living. I've twisted and turned my career paths from big tech and corporate finance, to finally listening to my heart and working remotely with a non-profit. Nice to e-meet you!

In recent years, there's something else I've found myself increasingly passionate about - [Sustainable Investing](https://www.sustainalytics.com/). Now, before your eyes glaze over thinking this is going to turn into a boring finance lecture, let me assure you my aim is not to make you a stock market whiz. However, I do want to make one grounded point: Sustainable investing isn't a rocket science, and it's high time we paid it some attention.

But hey, don't panic, this isn't your traditional Monday Montley Stock Update. Instead, imagine we are sitting in some hidden cafe in an underrated location, a [Spotify Indie playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX2MyUCsl25eb) oozing softly in the background, waiting for our freshly roasted coffee to arrive. 

Before we jump into the details, here's a fun fact: Much like how we choose to spend our money on ethically sourced products and services, we can choose to invest in companies that align with our values about the environment, social issues, and governance (affectionately referred to as 'ESG').

Let's break it down: a common way to practice sustainable investing is to engage in what's called 'ESG investing'. ESG stands for Environment, Social, and Governance. These are three central factors in measuring the sustainability and ethical impact of an investment in a company or business.

The goal here is to invest for financial return while also considering the future of our society and our planet. Think of it as 'mindful investing' - like you would practice [mindful yoga](https://www.mindful.org/mindful-yoga-way/), you're present at the moment, aware of your actions and the impact they have. 

Firstly, kickstart your ESG journey with some research. And yeah, I get it, diving deep into ESG ratings can initially feel as overwhelming as trying to learn a foreign language. Fortunately, there are resources to help. Sites like [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) and [Morning Star](https://www.morningstar.com/) now include ESG risk ratings to give you an idea of an entity's overall sustainability.

Secondly, seek out dedicated ESG funds. Many financial institutions offer funds that focus solely on sustainable investing. I recently started investing in a fund with [Aspiration](https://www.aspiration.com/), an eco-friendly financial partner who commit both to 'Do well' and 'Do good'. 

Lastly, remember that Investing sustainably doesn't entail compromising on returns. Thanks to growing consumer demand and increased regulatory support, many ESG funds have consistently outperformed conventional funds. According to a [CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/more-than-half-of-sustainable-funds-beat-their-benchmarks-in-2020.html), more than half of sustainable funds outperformed their index in 2020!

So, that's my beginner's guide to Sustainable Investing â€” simplified and hopefully, not too daunting! It's an exciting area to be involved with and brings a whole new way of thinking about investments. If you're someone who cares about the future of our society and our planet, I can't recommend it enough.

After all, as a wise man (alright, it was Yoda) once said, "Do or do not. There is no try." So why wait? Let's get started towards Sustainable Investing today!

Until next time,
Claire Lago
