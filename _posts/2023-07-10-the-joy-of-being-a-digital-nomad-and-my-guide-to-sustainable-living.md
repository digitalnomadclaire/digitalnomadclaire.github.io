Hey there lovely people, it's Claire Lago here. I'm a **32-year-old digital nomad**, a product manager by profession and a global wanderlust by the soul. Having worked for a variety of big tech giants and corporate finance firms, I now find myself submerged in the world of non-profit. But the best part, I get to do it remotely. Yippee!

However, today I want to talk about something that's really captured my heart and soul over the years — sustainable living within the digital nomad lifestyle.

Sustainable living isn't just about buying [organic foods](https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com), reducing waste, and conserving energy. It's also about **sustainable investing**. This kind of investing combines our goals for financial growth with our desire for a better world.

When travelling, I prefer exploring underrated locations and trying fine foods from every corner of the globe. There's nothing quite like the busy hum of a local market, the vibrant riot of colours in a foreign fruit stand, the seductive aroma of street food cooking. I document my culinary adventures through [photography](https://www.instagram.com/clairelago), capturing the essence of global cuisine in a frame.

But, amidst all this, I do my part to maintain the balance — by travelling eco-friendly. My mantra is to "leave no trace". I make use of services like [BlaBlaCar](https://www.blablacar.com/) for ridesharing or [Rent-a-Cycle](http://rentacycle.in/) when I'm in an exploration mood. Plus, what better way to experience a place than to pedal through the tiny lanes, right?

Working remotely has also helped me indulge in my love for things like hiking, yoga, indie music, and historical landmarks. In each place I visit, I make it a point to attend local gigs, practice yoga in stunning environments, and immerse myself in the vibrant histories that weave each city's rich tapestry. I've been using [BandsInTown](https://www.bandsintown.com/c) to keep track of local concerts — it's like a companion in my pocket that ensures I never miss a beat!

When it comes to accommodation, I usually opt for homestays or [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/). It gives me a chance to get a taste of the local lifestyle and also a wonderful opportunity to try homemade meals. On weekends, I enjoy discovering hidden cafes, vintage shopping, wine tasting, and participating in local arts and crafts workshops. 

Now, while this all sounds thrilling, a digital nomad lifestyle comes with its fair share of challenges too. One primary aspect is the need for financial management. That's why I've decided to share my personal finance experiences in my upcoming [blog](http://clairelagonomad.com/) post.

So folks, whether you're a digital nomad, making the shift toward sustainable living, or just curious, I hope my journey offers you insight and inspiration. After all, our planet is a diverse, vibrant community. Let's do our best to sustain it, while we enrich our lives with the beauty it offers.

Until next time, keep exploring, keep loving, keep living - sustainably!
