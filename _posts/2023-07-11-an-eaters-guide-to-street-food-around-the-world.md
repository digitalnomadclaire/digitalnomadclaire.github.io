Hey everyone! I'm Claire, your digital nomad friend who eats, drinks and breathes the global scene, from tech to tacos. I've had my fill of board meetings and balance sheets in my corporate days, and carved a new world for myself in the realm of non-profits, working remotely in locations you'd probably have to Google. 

I find joy in unearthing the unsung heroes of the culinary world, hopping from one food stall to another, from [Mexico City's Pujol](https://pujol.com.mx/en) to the hawker centers of Singapore. The whirlwind tastes and stories of street food I’ve encountered are what I’m sharing today.

### Mexico City - Taco Heaven

Having witnessed the spicy grandeurs of corporate finance, I do love a good kick to my food and boy, do the streets of Mexico deliver! I mean, tacos are classic comfort food, amirite? They may not be Wall Street, but food streets like Mercado de la Merced are a hustle and bustle of vibrant flavours waiting to be discovered. (And the best part? No ties allowed!)

### Singapore – Hawker Centres Galore

It's hard to overlook the seductive charms of the little Red Dot, Singapore, with its seductive blend of cultures and cuisines, as varied as the WeWork spaces dotting my past tech life. Chinatown Complex Food Centre has special residence in my heart (and stomach), with mouth-watering local delights such as char kway teow, roti prata and laksa.

### Istanbul - More than just Turkish Delights 

Istanbul gave me something far more valuable than a vintage find from a thrift shop - the mighty Doner kebab! Laden with seasoned meat shaved from a vertical rotisserie, it’s delicious street food, warmly wrapped with love.

### Next Stop

My expertise in tech project execution has helped me devise the perfect strategy to decode the hidden gems of street food. I'm packing my bags next for the street food scene in [Marrakech's Jemaa el-Fnaa](https://www.visitmorocco.com/en/travel/marrakesh/experiences/tasting-street-food-jemaa-el-fnaa) and the pho stalls of Hanoi, Vietnam. Can't wait to discover these underrated legends of street food!

Being a digital nomad has taught me the art of sustaining not just my interest in foods but also doing it mindfully. Exploring street foods, attending local gigs, absorbing the culture, is about engaging with the local economy and contributing towards sustainable travelling.

There's so much that street food culture has to offer. It’s not just nourishment, but a crash course in respecting and understanding the local traditions of cuisines. Each bite is an anthology of stories, of migration, trade, colonisation, survival and love. Try this humble form of dining on your next travel, you'd be surprised to find just how much you'll gain from it.

So friends, when you plan your next trip, forget that fancy restaurant. Walk down the busy lanes, follow the aroma, and discover the culinary delights hidden on each street corner.
