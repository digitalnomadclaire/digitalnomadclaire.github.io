Hi guys, Claire Lago here. As a digital nomad and a product manager turned non-profit worker, my life revolves around exploration and discovery. Moving from a corporate cubicle to the mesmerizing world of [non-profit work](https://www.ngo.org/careermag/interview/claire_lago), I've managed to balance my love for sustainability, fine foods, remote work, and cultural immersion. Today, I want to share with you one of my absolute favorite facets of this nomadic lifestyle: Exploring Global Markets.

I consider myself a real vagabond— a free spirit unattached to the physical land, but deeply integrated with the local culture, especially their markets. There’s so much charm in a market visit. I guess my passion for sustainable living, historical landmarks, local arts, and crafts really floods over in such spaces.

One of my most memorable market experiences was at the bustling [Chatuchak Weekend Market](https://www.chatuchakmarket.org/) in Bangkok. Evergreen plants, vintage vinyl, handmade crafts—this place is an absolute treasure trove! Plus, the street food was to die for. It's a must-visit for anyone lucky to find themselves in Bangkok.

But that's not all. Markets also offer a fantastic opportunity to be snapped for your [Instagram travel blog](http://www.instagram.com/claireonthemove). One of my cherished moments involves a chilly, early morning trip to the [Tsukiji Fish Market](https://www.tsukiji.or.jp/english/) in Tokyo. Sushi breakfast, anyone?

Before you start thinking I've gone off the deep end, let's connect this to something practical and meaningful: Investing. As an advocate for sustainable investing, I've found that exploring the local economy extensively can uncover hidden investment gems. Understanding locals' needs and consumption behavior is invaluable information for anyone interested in foreign economies or entrepreneurship.

I advise all my fellow digital nomads, or honestly anyone remotely interested in social impact initiatives and entrepreneurship, to set aside time in your travels to explore the local markets. Not only is it a great way to immerse yourself into the culture, but it also offers a wealth of knowledge and insights. Plus, what better way to spend a morning than tasting exotic local foods, admiring handcrafted arts, and conversing in foreign languages with local vendors?

If you're new to the market exploration scene, don't fret! I've got you covered with some tips for your market adventures:

1. **Early bird gets the worm**: Markets tend to get crowded as the day progresses. Arriving early ensures a less chaotic experience and a chance to interact more intimately with the vendors.
2. **Cash is king**: While digital wallets are commonplace now, a lot of traditional markets still operate on cash. Always carry some with you.
3. **Tasting is believing**: Street food is an integral part of the market culture. Use this opportunity to indulge and discover new flavors. Just keep some [antacids](https://www.amazon.com/TUMS-Antacid-Supplement-Assorted-Fruit/dp/B000GG6EU8) handy!
4. **Learn the lingo**: Knowing a few local phrases can open doors—the vendors appreciate it, and you might even get better deals!
5. **Reach out for local guidance**: Leverage your social networking skills or use apps like [Airbnb Experiences](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences) to find locals who can guide you around.

Remember, markets are a microcosm of the society and culture you're living in. So, immerse yourself, respect and value the culture and people, and cherish these unique experiences.

That's all for now! Catch you guys soon with more stories of my digital nomad lifestyle, sustainable travels, remote work escapades, and yoga retreats. Keep wandering!

Peace, love, and tacos,
Claire
