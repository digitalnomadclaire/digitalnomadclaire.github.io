Hey there world wanderers and digital nomads! It's Claire Lago, checking in from the vibrant city of Ho Chi Minh! Yes, you're right, my exotic location does change every couple of months! As a digital nomad product manager, the world is literally my office. 

One day, you might find me coding, amidst the hubbub of a bustling café in Barcelona, and on another, wrapped up in a tax discussion, with the mesmerizing views of Mt. Fuji in the back. And right about now? Well, I'm sitting at a hidden café in Ho Chi Minh City, drafting green strategies for the non-profit I work with. And trust me when I say, Vietnam’s [coffee culture](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05x9zvh) is unlike anything you’ll experience elsewhere. 

Years spent at bigger setups like Google and PWC gave me invaluable experiences and crazy stories to tell, but nothing that matches the adventure and fulfillment of working for a cause! Plus, the freedom to explore venues for those mandatory caffeine fixes and laptop sessions is simply unbeatable.

I truly enjoy discovering hidden cafés, often located down some understated alley. It's a joy to watch how artisanal coffee shops across the globe have become creative hubs, each reflecting their local culture, while contributing to a global coffee landscape. As a coffee lover and massive supporter of local businesses, it's an immersive experience I look forward to in each city I drop my anchor in. 

Running parallel to this love for quaint cafés, is my fascination for exploring global markets. The [Ben Thanh Market](https://www.vietnam-guide.com/ho-chi-minh-city/ben-thanh-market.htm) in Ho Chi Minh is my current daily haunt. It’s incredible how a simple local market helps decode the city’s culture, food, fashion, and even its history. Plus, the food stalls serve some lip-smacking street food. Here's a tip if you're ever in Ho Chi Minh: Do not miss out on the scrumptious Banh Mi!

Every day in these local markets offers a new learning experience. I’ve also picked up some fruits in Bali, spices in Istanbul, and various local crafts around South America. You’d be amazed by the diversity and global ties in these markets. 

Often, I supplement my visits to cafés and markets with some Yoga on-the-go. Yoga is my go-to for staying healthy and balanced in the midst of all the travel chaos. I've found numerous helpful online classes, like [Yoga with Adriene](https://yogawithadriene.com/) on YouTube. Even a quick 15-minute meditation helps reset my mind. It’s an amazing feeling with iconic views of the city around you.

Don't forget the bounty of street photography options these places have to offer! As an amateur [photographer](https://petapixel.com/2014/02/24/importance-addressing-why-shoot-street-photography/), my camera’s always eager to capture the vivid hustle of the markets and the quieter charm of cafés. It's an interesting contrast if you think about it.

Being a digital nomad isn't always easy; there's always a fine balance to be maintained with personal finance, but...agreed, it’s totally worth it! I’ve used many tools like [Mint](https://www.mint.com/), and apps like [Trail Wallet](https://www.trailwallet.com/) to effortlessly manage my finances from anywhere in the world. One day I’ll sit and compile my experiences and financial ideas for fellow digital nomads.

That's all for today! Can't wait to teleport you to my next destination! Remember to support local businesses, and keep exploring the amazing world we live in from your corner of the world, fellow tech-savvy wanderer!

Trivia: As I write this, I am sipping a Robusta coffee (extra strong) in a French colonial-style café with a Banh Mi in-hand, spinning off investment strategies to fund solar water pumps for remote African villages. Life, as they say...is good.

Until next time,
Signing off,
Claire Lago
