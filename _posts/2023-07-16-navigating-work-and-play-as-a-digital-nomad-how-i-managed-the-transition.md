Hello there, fellow wanderers! It's your girl Claire Lago, product manager by day and global explorer by... well, also by day. For those who haven't jumped on the bandwagon yet, I'm a [digital nomad](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/digital-nomad.asp). Yeah, one of those folks who shirked the 9 to 5 to work from anywhere, be it the beachfronts of Bali or the bustling markets of Marrakech. 

When I first swapped the corporate world's suits and ties for a backpack and laptop, friends and colleagues thought I was having some quarter-life crisis. But, hey, if my quarter-life crisis involves [practicing yoga](https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Meditation-1-Manduka-BLACK/dp/B0000AE66P/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=clai00-20&linkId=9c53ae205f0af91c3c90f1ef3426f0ed) beside the pyramids and exploring local [indie music scenes](https://www.songkick.com/metro_areas/33943-croatia-zagreb), I gotta tell you, it's pretty phenomenal.

Since taking the plunge into my new non-profit gig, I've realized it's so much more than just working on the fly. It's not all sipping latté in hidden cafes and hiking in unspoiled terrains. At times, it's also about rummaging for Wi-Fi, discovering [vegan street food](https://www.happycow.net/vegtopics/travel/street-food-around-world), and maneuvering our way through unfamiliar cityscapes (and languages). 

Though I was no stranger to hectic schedules and fast-paced tasks while working for big tech and corporate finance, embracing the digital nomad lifestyle challenged me in new but empowering ways. One aspect was sustaining my passion for [sustainable investing](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/918046/what-is-sustainable-investing) and making sure my work's social impact does not end with my projects. Creating a ripple effect towards better societies became more than just something nice to have; it became a must-have!

Part of my digital journey also includes embracing the [remote work](https://zoom.us/) culture, which has caught on like wildfire. With the right tools and apps, distance is never a barrier to meaningful interactions with my team or clients. Building my odd work hours around different time zones, and keeping communication lines open with individuals like me, scattered around the globe, has never been easier (or cooler!).

Whether working from a quaint Airbnb in Mozambique or a trendy co-working space in Barcelona, being a digital nomad has opened new worlds for me. I've enjoyed tasting and trying my hand at [global cuisine](https://www.masterclass.com/) - managing to scare a few friends with my not-so-successful adaptation of Thailand's fiery papaya salad at first! I’ve also experienced exploring [global markets](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/international-business-introduction/introduction-to-global-markets-qP6mu) more intimately than a textbook ever allowed.

Of course, traversing through this atypical career path had me learning to navigate personal finances and diving into the world of [entrepreneurship](https://www.udemy.com/topic/entrepreneurship/). From understanding market trends and networking with other entrepreneurs, to making a real difference with [charity work](http://www.givewell.org/), every experience from this journey continues to transform my compass.

Despite the hurdles and the constant learning curve, every minute spent being a digital nomad is worth it. If you're contemplating making the leap, remember, there’s a world of bustling markets, majestic landmarks, and diverse cultures waiting to be experienced. Embrace the unknown, follow your passions, and find that perfect mix of work and play. It's not just a life for us nonconformist millennials; it's an adventure waiting to unfold.

Till my next update, folks! Stay wild, and wander on. The world is your office.
