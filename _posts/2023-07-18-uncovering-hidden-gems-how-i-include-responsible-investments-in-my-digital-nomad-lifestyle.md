Hey there, I'm Claire. Remember the globetrotting digital nomad who left her corporate finance job for a purposeful non-profit workflow? Well, that's me, and let me tell you, the change has been invigorating so far. In-between managing workflows and attending virtual meetings, I recently started exploring the world of [sustainable investing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sri.asp), merging my love for finance with my newfound passion for sustainable living.

As someone who enjoys savory foods from around the world, what if I told you that your investment diet can and should reflect your values as well? I am talking about the investment equivalent of choosing farm-to-table, sustainable seafood, and organic wine to match. Welcome to the exciting world of responsible investing.

It's not all about profits and losses anymore. The world is changing, and so is the game of investment. Sustainable investing, also known as [ESG investing](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/879494/what-is-esg), focuses on a company's environmental, social, and governance credentials. It's about creating a healthier financial future without compromising our planet's health.

Since I left my 9-5 job, I've traveled to many places that aren't in the limelight and running my day-to-day operations from hidden cafes. [Hyperlink](https://www.google.com/maps) has been my best friend for finding these hidden gems. But my favorite place is this quaint café in [Tallinn, Estonia](https://www.visitestonia.com/en). The vintage decor, historic neighborhood, and delicious coffee got me hooked. It’s the perfect place to sync with work, while reading up on which companies are hitting their ESG goals before I decide to invest.

Remote work has given me the freedom to balance my love for traveling, interest in global cuisines, and desire to invest consciously. My favorite resource for market research and investment advice is [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/), they have a specifically dedicated section for [sustainability](https://finance.yahoo.com/sustainable-investing/) where they highlight green companies.

Now you might wonder how I got into mindful spending and investing, right? Well, the journey of 25+ countries, meeting the locals, tasting street food, exploring local arts and crafts, it all made me value the local economy. The hike in the Himalayas or the Yoga retreat in Bali wasn't just travel experiences. They were lessons on how mindful living can bring change.

Moreover, the more I got into finer foods from different cultures, the more my curiosity grew towards how these brands are working towards sustainability and giving back to communities. This interest soon turned into a habit, where with every dollar I am spending, I started considering the business's social impact initiatives.

Attending local gigs have always been my thing, the more, the merrier. And trust me, the indie music scene is insane globally. The raw talent, heart-touching lyrics filled with local stories. Before I realized it, even my music streaming reflected my love for supporting indie artists. I use [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/), a platform that supports artists directly, and you get to enjoy fresh tunes in return. It's a win-win.

In the end, based on my experience, sustainable investing is a long-term commitment, not a get-rich-quick scheme. It's about aligning your financial decisions with your values. Moving forward, I'm excited to keep learning, exploring, and sharing how fine foods, responsible investing, and the digital nomad lifestyle continue to shape my life.

Stay tuned for more of my adventures in the world of travel, food, culture, investment, and everything in between. Until then, happy investing, happy traveling!

Keep exploring. Keep investing.
