Hey there, fellow wanderlust warriors! I’m Claire Lago, a 32-year-old digital nomad, currently dipping toes in a non-profit venture while working remotely from a quaint seaside town in Portugal. Farewell to the hustle and bustle of Silicon Valley and the rigidity of corporate finance. I have exchanged my suit and high heels for a laptop and a pair of hiking boots. 

Traveling the world, engaging with diverse cultures, and working the digital way is something that resonates with my soul. Life has been a fantasy ride since I embraced this lifestyle. There's nothing like waking up with the fervor to discover yet another hidden gem in an underrated location, or finding the next [delicious dish to savor from global cuisine](https://www.loveandlemons.com/26-favorite-healthy-international-recipes/), or slipping into a yoga routine amidst the lush beauty of nature. And the best part? I get to do all of this, while working. 

Being on the move means my work is diverse, flexible and fascinating. Over the years, I have discovered various co-working spaces in alleyway cafes, eccentric libraries, sunlit terraces overlooking scenic beauty or in old historic buildings turned into modern hubs. My work in the non-profit sector involves managing financial tasks, conducting market research, developing and managing digital product strategies, and a lot more. I have had the opportunity to incorporate sustainability in my professional and personal life- strategizing for a [sustainable investment](https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/sustainable-investing-a-smarter-way-to-do-well-and-do-good) portfolio, while practicing sustainable living every day.

Fashioned with sustainable choices, my carry-on suitcase is my home. I've curated my needful essentials over time that aid in making life simpler, such as my [eco-friendly travel gear](https://earthhero.com/product-category/travel/), the [yoga mat](https://www.manduka.com/collections/yoga-mats) that rolls up super small, a [heavy-duty power bank](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Portable-Double-Speed-Recharging/dp/B01JIWQPMW?th=1) for all my digital needs, and my unputdownable [Kindle E-reader](https://www.amazon.com/Paperwhite-replaceable-waterproof-storage-10th-generation/dp/B07741S7Y8). 

Being a digital nomad is not quite the Insta-influencer lifestyle it’s made out to be. Alongside all the freedom and the picturesque backdrops, comes the evident challenges; keeping track of personal finance and maintaining a healthy work-life balance while traversing different time zones, are just a few to name.

But hey, I’m not flowing with this current just for the highs, but also to sail through the lows with grace and ease. After all, we only have one life. 

For me, this life is about my love for [photography](https://www.instagram.com/claires_camera/?hl=en), immersing in the local arts and music scenes, participating in social impact initiatives, exploring global markets, vintage shopping, learning foreign languages, and my obsession for [wine tasting](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/wine-tasting-101). Not to forget my insatiable appetite to try out the finest foods from around the world. I feast upon the diverse culinary experiences that this vast world has to offer. 

Yet, despite all the thrill and excitement my wanderlust lifestyle conveys, finding a quiet moment for mindfulness and meditation is often my key to a balanced lifestyle. I have found that it’s equally essential to remain grounded and aligned to my inner self, as it is to explore and connect with the world outside.

In essence, my perpetual journey is filled with invigorating experiences, enriching lessons, and extraordinary encounters. Striding the streets of bustling cities, hiking up the serene mountains or attending local gigs featuring indie music, day or night, the excitement never ends when you live a life of a digital nomad as I do. 

And in my sporadic solitude, I always find time to pen down my thoughts and view the world through my lens, connecting with the universal spirit of wanderlust warriors, just like you. And as we exchange stories, I live mine and find myself amid the chaos and tranquilities of the world. 

On this note, I would like to invite you to join my wandering journey by following my [blog](https://clairestalesofwanderlust.com/). 

Let’s connect through journeys, moments, and experiences. After all, life is about bonding over shared stories, isn’t it?
