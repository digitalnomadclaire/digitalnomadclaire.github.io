Hey there!

My name’s Claire and I used to be your typical employee working a 9-to-5 in the big tech and corporate finance scene. Fast forward a few years, and now you’re likely to find me working in an open-air cafe somewhere along the coast of Mexico, typing away on my laptop in between sips of my espresso.

I’m a proud [digital nomad](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/digital-nomad.asp), a remote product manager for an incredible [non-profit organization](https://www.charityjob.co.uk/jobs/?keywords=remote&page=1), now experiencing life beyond the corporate world. I swapped my office cubicle for the allure of the open road, trading in my power suits for beach clothes, and heels for flip-flops. 

Going digital nomad was not a flip-of-the-switch decision for me. It was a slow and deliberate journey. I started by integrating some of my passions – like sustainable investing and global cuisine – into my daily routine; I packed my savings into [eco-friendly investments](https://www.moneyunder30.com/green-investing), and began a food blog where I wrote about my love for [global cuisines](http://globaltableadventure.com).

As my interest in a flexible remote lifestyle grew stronger, I began attending local gigs of indie musicians, exploring underrated travel locations, discovering hidden cafes, and spending more time doing yoga and meditation. I started reading more books about the [digital nomad lifestyle](https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357).

My thirst for cultural immersion took me to offbeat historical landmarks and bustling global markets. Hiking and other outdoor activities became my new recreation, and I found joy in street food tasting, mingling with local music scenes, vintage shopping, and even wine tasting. This way, I got to experience new cultures, learn different languages, help out in local arts and crafts, and occasionally indulge in the high of discovering places that very few tourists ventured into. 

Working remotely has not only allowed me to fulfill my wanderlust but also pursue my interests in personal finance and entrepreneurship. I utilize some of my free time in supporting social impact initiatives and charity work. This shift towards a more conscious and sustainable lifestyle has been one of the best decisions I've made, and a big part of my 'why' when it comes to my career choices.

Above all, being a digital nomad pushes you to adapt, learn, and experience different cultures. Each day brings new experiences and fresh perspectives, whether it’s the meticulous art of preparing regional food, the detailed craft of local artisans, or appreciating the simple joy of connecting with people from different walk of life.

I take photos of my adventures, write about them, and share them on social media. It helps me connect with other digital nomads, share experiences, and learn from one another. My passion for fine foods allows me to document my culinary experiences. Also, I make a point to seek out locally-sourced food and sustainable establishments, which has led me into some pretty amazing kitchens and vineyards.

Being a digital nomad has significantly increased the quality of my life. It’s more than just the freedom to travel, but also the opportunity to contribute in a meaningful way – both professionally and personally. It has connected me to the world on a deeper level that’s difficult to explain, but easy to feel. 

Adventure has always been a part of me and being a digital nomad has given me a chance to live that out. So, if you’re someone sitting in a cubicle and finding yourself longing for more, know that there's an entire world out there waiting to be explored!

So to you fellow (or aspiring!) global grubs and digital nomads, I raise my mug of [artisanal coffee](https://www.bluebottlecoffee.com/) in toast. May we find the unknown, explore the hidden, and savor every bit of this beautiful world.

Catch you on the flip-side!
