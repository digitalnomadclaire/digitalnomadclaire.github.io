Good day, fellow adventure seekers! It's your gal Claire here, a 32-year-old digital nomad product manager experiencing the best of the world one day at a time through remote work. A little about me: I've had my time at big tech and corporate finance, and these days, I'm passion-driven, working remotely for this awesome non-profit I love.

I've visited countless underrated locations, sated my palate with foods from around the world, and indulged in my passion for sustainable investing - but there's always more to discover! Today, we’re going to talk about the ultimate journey of a digital nomad: finding hidden cafes and exploring the street food culture in underrated locations.

Let's start with sipping exotic coffee in a tucked-away café in [Ho Chi Minh City](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/ho-chi-minh-city), Vietnam. Amidst the bustling city chaos, [@theidcafe](https://www.instagram.com/theidcafe/) has an authentic charm that offers the perfect escapade. With a cup of their special egg coffee, a must-try when in Vietnam, and my trusty MacBook, I could get lost in my remote work that is not-so-remote and feel just at home!

Next, my fine food adventures took me to a local street food stall named '[El Guero](https://www.elguero.com.mx/)' in Mexico City. The sight of fresh ingredients transforming into delicious 'tacos al pastor' right before your eyes? Simply beautiful. And, a whispered secret for the foodies out there – an extra course of ‘churros’ is simply the perfect end to any meal.

While these are my top picks, I'm always on the hunt for the next best hidden café or street food stall on my [NomadList](https://nomadlist.com/) itinerary. Blending work with travel and food discoveries is just one of the ways I keep the digital nomad flame burning.

If you're stepping into this digital nomad life or are just a travel-food enthusiast who's all about sustainable living, I recommend [Impact Travel Alliance](https://www.impacttravelalliance.org/), a community driving change through travel. Trust me, eco-friendly travel with a sprinkle of mindful practices just enriches your journey to a whole another level!

On the money front, staying on top of personal finance is crucial, especially when you're constantly on the move. Many digital nomads and entrepreneurs vouch for [You Need a Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/), a budgeting tool that's perfect for nomadic finance management. Because hey, handling money judiciously means more city hopping, right?

In these travels, photography plays a big part. Capturing streets bustling with culture, historical landmarks, local gigs, and (of course) picturesque cafés, makes the journey all the more memorable. Check out Adobe's [Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) - it's been my best friend in creating and sharing those perfect travel pictures.

At the end of the day, immersing in foreign cultures, discovering food & wine, exploring global markets, hiking, or just curling with a good book at a quaint café in some corner of the earth, little moments make the digital nomad life an incredible journey. It's about savoring our lives, one adventure at a time. Love it, embrace it!

Next time, let's dive deep into the world of sustainable investing and how you can intertwine it with your nomad lifestyle. Stay tuned and remember, the world is your office!
