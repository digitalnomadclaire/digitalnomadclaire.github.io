Hey you! I'm Claire Lago. I'm a digital nomad, and I've traversed big tech and corporate finance. Now I'm a product manager for a non-profit. Yes, it's as rewarding and challenging as it sounds. Today, I'm hitting you with some honest straight talk about the realities faced day in and out as a part of this so-called "the digital nomad" lifestyle.

Terrible coffee shop Wi-Fi. Negotiating time zones. Looking for places that meet my environmentally friendly lifestyle. It's a wild ride, but I wouldn't trade it for anything else. The ability to work remotely while exploring the hidden corners of the world and indulging in my global cuisine passion is something I always yearned for. And believe me, learning about [sustainable investing](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/974590/the-pros-and-cons-of-esg-investing) has never been more exciting than when done in an understated café in the heart of Hanoi.

Recently, I've taken to working for a non-profit. It's a fulfilling experience, impacting societal causes and still working my magic in product management. This job marries my love for entrepreneurship, personal finance, and social impact initiatives perfectly. And the beauty of it? I can do it from anywhere in the world!

Not all roses, though, this lifestyle calls for a certain level of discipline, perseverance, and flexibility. Imagine being in the middle of a [yoga routine](https://www.downdogapp.com/) during a layover in Istanbul's airport. That's my life, and it's as unconventional, and thrilling as it sounds.

In my travels, I often make it a point to explore regional markets. You'd be surprised at the crafts and eco-friendly trinkets you can find here! Local gigs, especially the ones with indie music, are always on my radar. If you haven't experienced the wholeness of a small, tight-knit community swaying to the tunes of a local band, you're seriously missing out. 

Historical landmarks, street food tasting, vintage shopping - they’re a part of my to-do list, every time I touchdown in a new city. However, nothing beats the tranquility of a serene hiking trail or the intoxicating aroma of a [coffee beans](https://tradecoffeeco.com/) from a cozy cafe tucked away from the hustle.

I've learned that balance is everything in this lifestyle. Work becomes a part of your travel, and travel becomes a part of your work. Being a part of the non-profit sector has made me more empathetic and patient, which I believe has positively influenced my personal and professional life. Working amidst cultural diversity has also opened my mind, encouraging me to continuously learn and grow.

In this journey, I have also found solace in writing, and capturing my memories through my [camera lens](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1442822-REG/canon_eos_r_mirrorless_digital.html) has become second nature. Blogging about this unique way of life has become a passion and a way for me to connect with similar minds. It truly has enriched my experience as a digital nomad.

Encouraging sustainable living, embracing new cultures, discovering local arts, wine tasting from local vineyards, and above all, enjoying fine foods at every stop – That’s my life now. And it keeps getting better!

Join me in my journey, navigate through the highs and lows of the digital nomad lifestyle. It is not for everyone, but if you’ve got an itch to explore, a yen for working in your terms, and an open mind to embrace variegated experiences - come on in, the water's fine. 

Remember, as [Audrey Hepburn](https://www.biography.com/actor/audrey-hepburn) famously said, "Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, ‘I’m possible!'". 

Thanks for reading, folks! And, follow along my adventures, ups and downs via my posts here. Let’s do this digital nomad thing together. Sure, it may be tough at times, but I can personally testify - it’s worth every single espresso cup. 

To being fabulous, always! Catch you later.

Claire.
